## Simple User CRUD API with Laravel and Repository Pattern

Simple User CRUD API with Laravel and Repository Pattern
This is a simple user CRUD API that is built using Laravel and the repository pattern. The repository pattern is a design pattern that helps to decouple the code that interacts with the database from the code that uses the data. This makes the code more modular and easier to test.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the dependencies by running `composer install`.
- Create a database and configure the database connection in `.env` file.
- Run the migrations by running `php artisan migrate`.
- Seed the database with some data by running `php artisan db:seed`.
- Start the Laravel development server by running php artisan serve.
## API Endpoints
The API exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /users` - Get all users
- `GET /users/{id}` - Get a user by ID
- `POST /users` - Create a new user
- `PUT /users/{id}` - Update a user
- `DELETE /users/{id}` - Delete a user

## Testing
The API can be tested using Postman. A Postman collection is included in the repository. To import the collection, open Postman and click on the Import button. Select the `Laravel Design Patterns.postman_collection.json` file from the repository.

The Postman collection contains requests for all of the API endpoints. You can use the requests to test the API and verify that it is working correctly.
